  This is a Clojurescript interface to Google Maps that takes a
  sequence of latitude and longitude coordinates and time stamps.  It
  displays the coordinates on a Google Map in the order of the time
  stamps, with a delay between displaying the coordinates proportional
  to the delay between the time stamps.

  Also included is a Clojure program for converting a file full of
  emails from [[http://findmespot.com][SPOT]] into a sequence that is suitable for input to the
  Clojurescript program.
